        <h2>Community Action & Shelter Repurposing</h2>
        <p>
            Shelters do incredible work — but what if we could reduce the number of animals arriving in the first place?
        </p>
        <p>
            PUPPP’s supports ideas that shift the focus toward prevention: community-based teams who help solve problems before pets are surrendered, and who follow up after adoption to ensure lasting homes.

        <div id="action-plan-1" class="expandable-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Did you know that some other countries manage pet animal welfare by strictly regulating how many persons are licensed to breed and the numbers of litters and total pet population? For example, Germany has around ten million pets compared to the U.S. with nearly ninety million dogs and eighty-eight million cats. These figures only account for known pets, with actual numbers likely much higher. It's no wonder shelters are overwhelmed and euthanasia rates are high; our society simply cannot support such large numbers.</p>
            <p>While there are many related factors, currently (late 2025) many surrenders are due to owners losing their housing, general costs to keep pets, and medical care costs. Shelters are overwhelmed, which is both sad and unfair to the animals. Dedicated volunteers and staff are doing their utmost to house and care for as many as possible, hoping to find them homes. The overwhelming volume of homeless pets is at an all-time high, serving as a <b>neon sign</b>: <b>we need immediate new animal welfare laws strictly enforced until numbers are greatly reduced. A new lower volume threshold must be obtained and then maintained.</b> Please take action, be a voice for animals and help bring much needed change!</p>
            <h3>Here’s an action plan:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reach out to your community leaders and lawmakers, initiate and drive creation of laws (examples to propose below), gather petition signatures in your community in order to qualify to appear on next ballot, or, pursue leaders who have the willingness and ability to enact changes directly.</li>
                <li>Enforced laws requiring <b>all</b> breeders to be licensed and registered in their state, with the number of licenses given out based on adoption rate statistics minus fifty percent until all shelters are at 20% capacity with zero euthanasia of healthy pets. Credentials and requirements should be high, with inspections and on-going monitoring. <b>No</b> “backyard breeders” or pet owners “having just one litter.” Heavy financial penalties should effectively change behavior, and repeat offenders face jail time. Once under control, the number of breeder licenses can be reviewed.</li>
                <li>Hotlines for community members to report roadside signs “puppies for sale.” A social media campaign to educate everyone, before buying a puppy from a breeder, to demand to see their license and verify its legitimacy online. Financial penalties should be imposed for non-compliance. Unlicensed breeders should be fined $5000 per puppy they sell/sold or have in their possession for a first offense, and double plus a year of jail per puppy for repeat offenders. People should be fined $5000 for purchasing from an unlicensed breeder. (Penalties should be proportional to the estimated cost of proper care for an overpopulated pet, high enough to deter non-compliance.)</li>
                <li>All pets spay/neuter for free, mandatory, and enforced. Owners adopting or rescuing unneutered/unspayed animals would be responsible for ensuring the procedure is done when the pet is old enough and safe to do so.</li>
                <li>Community-based action teams working directly with pet owners to resolve issues before surrender, offering hotlines and assistance locations. Most surrenders are due to financial and behavioral issues. By offering training and behavior modification support as well as financial support, fewer pets will be surrendered. Post-adoption support programs, with volunteers ensuring successful transitions and providing ongoing support to prevent re-surrenders.</li>
                <li>Repurposing shelter space for telehealth, community clinic services, and training.</li>
                <li>Oversight: staff and personnel from some of the rescue organizations, since there will be fewer needing rescue.</li>
                <li>Funding: calculate the amount needed and add 0.05% to county tax rates and/or a portion to federal tax structures. This is a societal issue; everyone should be part of the solution. This is similar to how a small portion of taxes supports schools, even for those without children. Another revenue source, if needed, would be an extra percentage tax on all pet goods and services (excluding veterinary care costs).</li>
                <li>Even if the initial plan isn't perfect, <b>something</b> is needed. Drastic cuts to overbreeding are a necessary starting point, with adjustments and management as needed.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Ending Animal Lab Experiments</h2>
        <p>
            More than 40,000 dogs are used in experiments each year in the U.S. funded with tax payer dollars.  In addition, tens of thousands of puppies destined for labs are born at breeding facilities each year.  This number increases dramatically worldwide. (of course this doesn’t account for kittens, monkeys and others and that number climbs even higher)
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of experiments, dogs are typically killed.  Many  are not given any pain medication to help relieve their suffering or distress during or after experiments.  This is NOT a small problem!  Experiments using dogs are happening in 46 U.S. states, D.C. and Puerto Rico.  The federal government plays a role by funding and requiring and carrying out these experiments.  In 2024 alone, the National Institutes of Health awarded over $ 50 million in tax dollars!
        </p>
        <p>
            The most effective approach to end these experiments on dogs (and other animals) is to cut off the funding and you can help by signing petitions regarding legislation, and letters to representatives.  By clicking the links  below you can easily take action that will contribute to ending animal suffering, and demand investment in research that doesn’t cause animal suffering.  The other action you can take to support animals is to share links and information with others.  Only through awareness can we take positive action for the innocent animals.
