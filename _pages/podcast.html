            <h2>The PUPPP’s Podcast</h2>
            <p>
                Starting January 2026, Joan will host a weekly podcast featuring honest, inspiring conversations with veterinarians, activists, policy-makers, and pet lovers.
                Each episode is grounded in one goal: empowering listeners to take better care of animals — and take real action where it matters.

            <h3>🩺 Pet Health Series</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional and holistic vets explore diets, vaccines, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and rising cancer and diabetes rates in pets.
                We’ll challenge “big kibble,” discuss the data behind commercial pet foods, and highlight what truly supports long-term animal health.

            <h3>🏘️ Rethinking Shelter Overpopulation</h3>
            <p>
                Why wait until pets are surrendered? We’ll explore successful city models that deploy proactive teams into communities — helping pet owners before crisis hits, and following up after adoption.
                A smarter system, with better outcomes for animals and families alike.

            <p>
                Join us as we talk with organizations pushing legislative change at state and federal levels.
                We'll celebrate victories, uncover upcoming hurdles, and share how anyone can get involved — even without donating.
