        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>
            This collection of short stories is based on the real lives of pets â€” and the people who love them.
            Many of them were clients of Joanâ€™s upscale grooming salon, POSH Pet Boutique and SPAw.
            Each day brought new drama, humor, insight, and love â€” a kind of unscripted live theater featuring
            quirky personalities, life lessons, and the occasional celebrity pet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wherever you live, and whoever your furry family members may be, this book is a celebration of the deep emotional bond we share with animals.

<h2 data-aos="fade-up">From the Foreword</h2>

<blockquote data-aos="fade-up">
    The universal spirit of pet ownership transcends political, religious, racial, and geographic differences.
    Pet people are united by love â€” and able to express it freely, without judgment.
    This book is a tribute to that bond â€” and to the pets and people who live it, every day.
