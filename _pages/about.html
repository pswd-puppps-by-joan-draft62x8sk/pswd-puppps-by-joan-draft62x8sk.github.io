                Joan has always shared a special bond with animals — one built on empathy, trust, and a deep belief in the emotional connection between humans and pets.
                As the founder of Posh Pet Boutique and SPAw, she spent years surrounded by furry characters, loving clients, and heartwarming stories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those stories — the funny ones, the messy ones, the meaningful ones — became the inspiration behind her book and the foundation for what’s next.
